## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Firebase CLI installed
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd mad_inclass14
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase** (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Choose platforms (Android, iOS, etc.)
   - This will generate the correct `firebase_options.dart` file

4. **Enable Firestore**:
   - Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
   - Create database in test mode

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🔧 Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_core: ^2.19.0
  cloud_firestore: ^4.12.0
```

## 📝 Usage

### Adding Products
- Tap the ➕ floating action button
- Enter product name and price
- Tap "Add" to save

### Editing Products
- Tap the ✏️ edit icon on any product
- Modify name or price
- Tap "Update" to save changes

### Deleting Products
- Tap the 🗑️ delete icon on any product
- Product is immediately deleted from Firestore

### Search & Filter
- **Search**: Type in the search bar to find products by name
- **Price Filter**: Enter min/max prices and tap "Filter"
- **Reset**: Tap "Reset" to clear filters and show all products

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the App

### Using VS Code
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select "Flutter: Select Device"
3. Press `F5` or use "Run and Debug" panel

### Using Terminal
```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Run in debug mode
flutter run --debug

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

### Using VS Code Tasks
A Flutter Run task has been configured. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Flutter Run"

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration Notes

The app includes a placeholder `firebase_options.dart` that will show configuration errors until you run `flutterfire configure`. This is intentional - the file will be replaced with your actual Firebase project configuration.

## 🧪 Testing CRUD Operations

1. **Create**: Add several products with different names and prices
2. **Read**: Verify products appear in the list, sorted by name
3. **Update**: Edit a product and confirm changes persist
4. **Delete**: Remove a product and verify it's gone
5. **Search**: Test searching by product name
6. **Filter**: Test price range filtering
